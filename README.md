# Word-Prediction-Web-App
This web app was the final project of the Data Science Specialization through Johns Hopkins and Coursera. 
The application uses a corpus provided by SwiftKey of text, and email messaging. 
The data was parsed into N-grams to create a Natural Language Processing model.
The NLP model was used to build a Word Prediction App along with Shiny Apps and R programming.
